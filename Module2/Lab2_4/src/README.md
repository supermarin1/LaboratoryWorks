  Create class MyMath with two static methods (findMin and findMax), which will take array of int values 
  as argument and return minimum element value (for findMin method) or  maximum element value (for findMax method).  
    
  2-4-2  
  Create class Calculation, which will create two arrays of integers and use findMin and findMax static methods of MyMath class.  
    
  2-4-3  
  Add to class MyMath final static field PI = 3.14 and static method areaOfCircle(), 
  which will take radius, use constant PI and calculate area.

  1) Create Employee class with fields firstName, lastName, occupation, telephone and static field numberOfEmployees and getters/setters.   
  2) Class must have constructor, which will initialize class fields and increment numberOfEmployees.  
  3) Create multiple instances of Employee class and the output numberOfEmployees field to the console.

  The value of π can be calculated with the series: π = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11 + ...  
  Write a class MyCalc with public static method calcPi(int) that takes as parameter an integer n, 
  and computes and returns the value of π approximated to the first n terms of the series.

  Write a class MyPyramid with public static method printPyramid(int h) that takes parameter an integer h between 1 and 9, 
  and prints a pyramid of numbers of height h.  Example: For h = 4 the method should print the pyramid
