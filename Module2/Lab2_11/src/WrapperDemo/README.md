  Open project  WrapperDemo2 (from 2.10 lab).  
  Add to class Main assertions code that checks correct result of executing compute( , ) method. 
  The compute( , ) method use as argument s two different numeric wrapper classes, 
  adds the values of the two instances together, and then creates a third numeric wrapper instance whose value is the sum and return it.  
  In method main() write code to invoke compute(,) in assertion and compare to correct result.  
  1.	Execute the program.  
  2.	Execute the program with –ea VM parameter.  
  3.	Change code in compute( , ) method,  for example change return statement to:  
  return 0; Execute the program.  
  4.	Execute the program with –ea VM parameter.
