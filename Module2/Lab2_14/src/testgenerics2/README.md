   Create new project called  TestGenerics2. 
Add package “com.brainacad.oop.testgenerics2”.  
1)	Create class MyTestMethod with generic static method calcNum (with two parameters: an array T[] and variable maxElem of type T)
that counts the number of elements in an array T[] that are greater than a specified element maxElem.  
2)	Create a class Main with a main() method. Add to method main() code that creates two array, first – array of Integer type and second –
array of Double type. Fill these arrays with some random values.  
Add code to counts the number of elements in each of arrays that are greater than a specified element by invoking calcNum() static method.   
3)	Execute the program.  
The program output must be like next example:  
Array values: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]  
Number of elements that are greater than 3: 6  
Array values: [1.1,2.2,3.3,4.4,5.5,6.6,7.7,8.8,9.9] Number of elements that are greater than 3:
